# Thank you to all readers of my blog, events participants & organizers.

In the last year I have spent a lot of time contributing to the community and sharing knowledge. Anyone working in IT knows that free knowledge is available at your fingertips, and I have benefited from it many times. I have always needed to repay it by sharing when I learn something. Yesterday I was recognized with the title of Microsoft Azure MVP in Azure Patterns & Practices technology area, which lets me know that what I do has value to you, and it is worth the effort.

**See you next year in the same place at the same time!**
