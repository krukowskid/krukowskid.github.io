I remember just a few years ago, static websites weren't as popular. But nowadays, with all these tools and frameworks allowing client-side rendering, there's often no need for anything more than a frontend.

For hosting my blog, I'm using a Jekyll engine combo with GitHub Actions and GitHub Pages. The coolest thing? It's reliable and completely free (except for the domain name, of course, but you can use a free `.github.io` domain from GitHub Pages). Everything is written in Markdown, then compiled into static files using GitHub Workflows. You can check out all the files here: [krukowskid/krukowskid.github.io]

I used to use the great "minimal-mistakes" Jekyll template, but I just couldn't get the look I wanted. So, to improve your reading experience, I decided to switch to a paid version of the "hydejack" template with a few modifications of my own.

In addition to the layout changes, I recently implemented Disqus comments, which allow you to interact with me directly using your GitHub account. This is way more efficient than reaching out on LinkedIn. I also added a clap button that requires no login to any external service, and I've improved some things like codeblocks to make my posts even more readable. Plus, you can switch the color theme and use the search function at the top of the site!

I hope you like the changes!
